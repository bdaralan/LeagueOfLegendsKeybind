# League of Legends Keybind

<img src="assets/img/logo.png" class="logo" width="25%" alt="LoLKeybind">

A macOS app that allows league of legends players to quickly save and toggle keybind for specific champion.

The app does not use any special technique to map the key presses. All it does is updating League Client's keybind file before the game starts.

## How To

### Save Keybind (Pic Coming Soon)

1. Go to Setting (in game or lobby) > HotKey.
2. Modify the HotKey to your Ahri's E content.
3. When done, open the app and click *Save Client's Current Keybind* button.
4. Name the newly saved keybind.
5. Yep, that's it. Repeat the process for other champions.

### Toggle Keybind (Pic Coming Soon)

**NOTE:** make sure to do the following before the game starts (reason below).

1. Open the app or click on the app status bar icon
2. Select one of the saved keybind.
3. Yep, that's it. Enjoy your penta!

### Reason

- Currently modifying the file during the game does not take any affect.
- During the game, League Client does not seem to refresh any modification to the keybind file that is not done directly from the HotKey interface.

## Where is Windows Version?

On the todo list since most players are on Windows, but not sure when... σ(^_^;)

I happen to play league on Mac, so Mac first (๑° з°๑)<br>
I also am more of a Swift programming guy, so it will take a while for Windows (will most like to be written in Java). However, if this one goes well, it will definitely boost the motivation.
