# LeagueOfLegendsKeybind

A macOS app that allows league of legends players to quickly save and toggle keybind for specific champion.

This app does not use any special techinque to map the key presses. All it does is updating League Client's keybind file before the game starts.

## How To (Pic Coming Soon)

### Save Keybind

1. Go to Setting (in game or lobby) > HotKey.
2. Modify the HotKey to your Ahri's E content.
3. When done, open the app and click 'Save Client's Current Keybind' button.
4. Name the newly saved keybind.
5. Yep, that's it. Repeat the process for other champions.

### Toggle Keybind

1. **BIG NOTE:** *make sure to do the following before the game starts* (reason below).
2. Open the app or click on the app status bar icon
3. Select one of the saved keybind.
4. Yep, that's it. 

**REMINDER:** read step 1.

**REASON in step 1:** 

- Currently modifying the file during the game does not take affect.
- Plus, normally, you will find yourself doing this after setting up runes, summoners, and skin.

## Where to Download (Coming Soon)

If you know what you are doing, you can download the project and run it on your computer. :]

## Where is Window Version?

On the todo list since most players are on Windows, but not sure when... σ(^_^;)

I happend to play league on Mac, so Mac first (๑° з°๑)
Also, I am more familiar with Swift, so it will take a while for Windows. However, if this one goes well, it will definitely boost the motivation.
