# League of Legends Keybind

A macOS app that allows league of legends players to quickly save and toggle keybind for specific champion.

The app does not use any special technique to map the key presses. All it does is updating League Client's keybind file before the game starts.

## How To (Pic Coming Soon)

### Save Keybind

1. Go to Setting (in game or lobby) > HotKey.
2. Modify the HotKey to your Ahri's E content.
3. When done, open the app and click *Save Client's Current Keybind* button.
4. Name the newly saved keybind.
5. Yep, that's it. Repeat the process for other champions.

### Toggle Keybind

**NOTE:** make sure to do the following before the game starts (reason below).

1. Open the app or click on the app status bar icon
2. Select one of the saved keybind.
3. Yep, that's it.

### Reason

- Currently modifying the file during the game does not take any affect.
- During the game, League Client does not seem to refresh any modification to the keybind file that is not done directly from the HotKey interface.

Even so, normally, you will find yourself toggling the keybind after setting up runes, summoners, and skin, so there should not be any problem. :thumbsup:

## Where to Download (Coming Soon)

If you know what you are doing, you can download the project and run it on your computer. :]

## Where is Windows Version?

On the todo list since most players are on Windows, but not sure when... σ(^_^;)

I happen to play league on Mac, so Mac first (๑° з°๑)\
I also am more of a Swift programming guy, so it will take a while for Windows (will most like to be written in Java). However, if this one goes well, it will definitely boost the motivation.
