# League of Legends Keybind

A macOS app that allows league of legends players to quickly save and toggle keybind for specific champion.

The app does not use any special technique to map the key presses. All it does are saving and restoring League Client's keybind file before the game starts.

## Features

### Save Keybinds

Allows players to save keybinds for specific champoins.

1. From the game client, navigate to HOTKEYS.
2. Modify the HOTKEYS to your Ahri's E or Evelynn's W content.
3. When done, open the app and click *Save Client's Current Keybind* button.
4. Name the newly saved keybind.

Yep, that's it. Just repeat the process for other champions.

### Toggle Between Keybinds

Allows players to select one of the saved keybinds before the *game start*.

1. Open the app or click on the app status bar icon.
2. Select one of the saved keybinds.

Yep, that's it. Now, go grab that pen-Katari-ta!

## FAQ

1. Why need to select keybind before the game start?
    - Currently modifying the file during the game does not take any affect.
    - During the game, League Client does not seem to refresh any modification to the keybind file that is not done directly from the HOTKEYS interface.
2. Where is Windows version?
    - Since most players are on Windows, it is on the todo list, but not sure when... Ïƒ(^_^;)
    - I happen to play league on Mac, so yeah.
    - My strong programming language is Swift, so it will take a while for Windows (will most like to be written in Java). However, if this one goes well, it will definitely boost the motivation.
